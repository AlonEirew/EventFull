        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>We aim to determine which events can be anchored in time, i.e., have a well-defined notion of time.<br>
            At this stage, you will see a paragraph with events marked in <span class="label NA">blue</span>, indicating event mentions that require annotation.<br>
            For each event, you need to decide whether it can be <span class="label ANC">anchored</span> in time or <span class="label NOT">not</span>.</p>

        <p>For example, given the sentence:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In Washington today, the Federal Aviation Administration <span class="label NA">released</span> air traffic control tapes from the night the TWA Flight 800 went down.</p>

        <p>Can the event <span class="label NA">released</span> be anchored in time?<br>
            We say an event can be anchored on a real timeline if and only if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Case 1: The event happened in the past or is happening now.</li>
            <li>Case 2: The event is unconditionally planned to happen in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes," and the event should be marked in <span class="label ANC">green</span> (using the mouse button).</p>
    </div>

    <p>When is an event mention <b>not</b> anchorable in time?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Case 1: The event is hypothetical or conditional (e.g., If I get the money, I will <span class="label NOT">redecorate</span> the house).</li>
        <li>Case 2: The event is a negation (e.g., He did not <span class="label NOT">attend</span> the conference).</li>
        <li>Case 3: The event is abstract or non-specific (e.g., It's amazing that a 975,000-pound Boeing 747-8 can <span class="label NOT">fly</span>).</li>
        <li>Case 4: The event is static (e.g., any auxiliary verb).</li>
        <li>Case 5: The event is recurrent (e.g., The team <span class="label NOT">meet</span> once a week for briefing).</li>
        <li>Case 6: The event is an intention, wish, or opinion (e.g., Wouldn't it be wonderful if they start <span class="label NOT">dating</span>?).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b><u>Please note:</u></b> To complete this step, all events must be marked as either <span class="label ANC">anchorable</span> or <span class="label NOT">not</span>.<br>
        Once this is done, the <button class="button-next-task">Next Task</button> button will be enabled.</p>
