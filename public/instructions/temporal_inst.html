    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>You'll see sentences with two events marked with different colors and you need to decide the temporal order taking into consideration only the starting time of the events. For example,</strong></p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      <em>[A traveler is <span style="color: royalblue">kidnapped</span>, and the police officers <span style="color: orangered">said</span> the kidnapper is demanding money.]</em>
    </p>

    <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Which event started first?</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="color:rgb(97, 189, 109);">kidnapped (You need to choose this)</li>
      <li>said</li>
      <li>Both started at the same time</li>
      <li>Uncertain</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> (<span style="color: royalblue">kidnapped</span>) DEFINITELY started before (<span style="color: orangered">said</span>) if we consider the chain of events.
      The 2nd answer is obviously NOT POSSIBLE. The 3nd answer might be possible if considering that kidnapped event is still ongoing. However, <strong>even if an event is durative, e.g., (<span style="color: royalblue">kidnapped</span>) is during a period of time, you only need to consider the
      STARTING time (when the event began/started) to make the decision.</strong>

    <p><strong>Not all cases are a clear-cut as (<span style="color: royalblue">kidnapped</span>) and (<span style="color: orangered">said</span>). For example,</strong></p>
    <p>[I <span style="color: royalblue">ate</span> a burger and <span style="color: orangered">drank</span> a bottle of water for lunch today.]</p>

    <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Which event started first?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ate</li>
      <li>drank</li>
      <li>Both started at the same time</li>
      <li style="color:rgb(97, 189, 109);">Uncertain (You need to choose this)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> Here we only know that (<span style="color: royalblue">ate</span>) and (<span style="color: orangered">drank</span>) happened during lunchtime today.
      Based on the text, we cannot rule out the possibility that (<span style="color: royalblue">ate</span>) is earlier than (<span style="color: orangered">drank</span>),
      and we cannot rule out the possibility that (<span style="color: orangered">drank</span>) is earlier than (<span style="color: royalblue">ate</span>), either.</p>

    <h2>IMPORTANT RULE 2</h2>
    <p><strong>Two events may have exactly the same start time, although it's not quite often. For example,</strong></p>
    <p>[They (<span style="color: royalblue">filed</span>) objections to the court, (<span style="color: orangered">claiming</span>) that the suspects were treated unfairly.]</p>

    <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Which event started first?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>filed</li>
      <li>claiming</li>
      <li style="color:rgb(97, 189, 109);">Both started at the same time (You need to choose this)</li>
      <li>Uncertain</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> (<span style="color: royalblue">filed</span>) and (<span style="color: orangered">claiming</span>) are the same thing, so their start times are equal: neither before nor after.</p>

    <h2>RECOMMENDED STRATEGY</h2>
    <p><strong>For each question, try to place both events on a timeline considering only the starting time of the events. (1) Try to find explicit indicators between the events (before that, after, simultaneously, etc..), (2) use common sense (like in the above kidnapped example),
      and (3) In case common-sense is needed, try to determine the events order, test if changing the events order still makes sense, in case it does then its inconclusive/uncertain.</strong></p>
    <p>Take the above questions for example. First, assume (<span style="color: royalblue">kidnapped</span>) indeed starts before (<span style="color: orangered">said</span>) starts. Then ask yourself if it makes sense.
      We know from the sentence that the police are working on the kidnap, so based on common sense, the kidnap must start earlier so that the police can work on it.
      Any other way is logically impossible.</p>

    <p>In the (<span style="color: royalblue">ate</span>) and (<span style="color: orangered">drank</span>) example, first assume (<span style="color: royalblue">ate</span>) starts before (<span style="color: orangered">drank</span>) starts, does it makes sense?
      Then try to replace the order so now (<span style="color: royalblue">drank</span>) starts before (<span style="color: orangered">ate</span>), does it make sense?
      Since both cases makes sense, we cannot determine which one started first <u>inconclusively</u>.</p>
