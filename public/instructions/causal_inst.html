        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>You'll be asked to find the event(s) that is the reason another event have happened. To do so, you'll be given events that started (in time) before the event in question. You need to decide if one of those events was/is the reason. For example,</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <em>[The hurricane <span style="color: orangered">hit</span> the Florida coast causing severe property <span style="color: royalblue">damage</span>.]</em>
        </p>

        <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Why (<span style="color: royalblue">damage</span>) had (have/will) happened?</p>
        <a>Because of:</a><br>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled"><span style="color:rgb(97, 189, 109);">hit (You need to choose this)</span><br>
        </label>

        <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> (<span style="color: orangered">damage</span>) happened because the hurricane (<span style="color: royalblue">hit</span>) Florida coast,
            this case is rather simple as it is indicated explicitly in the sentence by the word <b>"causing"</b>.</p>

        <h2>IMPORTANT RULE 1</h2>
        <p><strong>Look for a clear indication in the context (i.e., causation words such as: cause, because, incite, influence, inspire, lead, prompt, push, force, make, set, start, trigger and so on).
            Such indicator can help make the decision when they exist and indicate one event caused the other.</strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong>However, Not all cases are a clear-cut as (<span style="color: orangered">hit</span>) and (<span style="color: royalblue">damage</span>), in many cases, there will be no clear indication in the sentence. For example,</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <em>[He <span style="color: orangered">loaded</span> the gun, <span style="color: orangered">shot</span> and <span style="color: royalblue">killed</span> the attacker.]</em>
        </p>

        <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Why (<span style="color: royalblue">killed</span>) had (have/will) happened?</p>
        <a>Because of:</a><br>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" style="font-weight: bold" disabled="disabled"><span style="color:rgb(97, 189, 109);">shot (You need to choose this)</span><br>
            <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled">loaded<br>
        </label>

        <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> Here we need to use a bit of common-sense to figure that (<span style="color: royalblue">killed</span>) happened because of (<span style="color: orangered">shot</span>).</p>

        <h2>IMPORTANT RULE 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Given an event in context, ask why the event happened, what triggered the event or caused it to happened. For example "why the attacker was killed?.
            We can search if the answer is one of the events in the list."</strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong>However, events are not always triggered by other events, for example:</strong></p>

        <p dir="ltr">
            <em>[She <span style="color: royalblue">arrived</span> home, <span style="color: royalblue">connected</span> to the Wifi and <span style="color: orangered">logged</span> in to her email account.]</em>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Why (<span style="color: royalblue">logged</span>) had (have/will) happened?</p>
        <a>Because of:</a><br>
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled">arrived<br>
            <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled">connected<br>
        </label>

        <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> (<span style="color: royalblue">logged</span>) didn't happened because she (<span style="color: orangered">arrived</span>) or (<span style="color: orangered">connected</span>).
            While the <span style="color: orangered">connected</span> event enabled her to log into her account, if we ask "why she logged into her email account?" a reasonable answer will be that she wanted to check her emails rather then because she connected to the WiFi.
            Events that enable the event in question to happened should not be considered as the causing events.
