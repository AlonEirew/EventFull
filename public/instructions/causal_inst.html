        <h1>Causal Step - Tool Overview</h1>
        <p>You will see a paragraph with one event marked in <span class="label ANC">green</span>, and all events that preceded it (selected as "after" in the temporal step)
            marked in <span class="label NOT">red</span>. You need to decide which of the red event mentions caused the green event to happen, is happening, or will happen (as further explained below in "Task Overview").</p>

        <p>After each selection, you can navigate to the next set of events requiring annotation using the <button class="button">Next Unhandled</button> button,
            or navigate sequentially through the sets of events using the <button class="button">Next</button> and <button class="button">Prev</button> buttons.
            Once all event mention sets have been annotated, a <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;" onclick="showAnnotCompleteAlert()">notification</a>
            indicating that the annotation process is complete will be displayed.</p>

        <p>Note that at this step, only events marked with before relation in the temporal task will be visible. Additionally, the graph edges representing causal relations will be highlighted, while those representing non-causal relations will appear faded. Last, manually selecting event mentions (nodes) from the graph visualization is not supported. However, you can move the nodes in the graph as you see fit.
        </p>

        <h2>Task Overview</h2>
        <p>Below are examples of how to perform the causal annotation task.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The hurricane <span class="label NOT">hit</span> the Florida coast, causing severe property <span class="label ANC">damage</span>.</p>

        <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Why has, is, or will <span style="color: #28A745">damage</span> happen?</p>
        <div class="checkbox-title">Because of:</div>
        <div class="styled-checkbox-container" style="display: block; height: calc(1 * 30px);">
            <label class="styled-checkbox">
                <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled">
                <span class="custom-checkbox"></span>
                hit
            </label>
        </div>

        <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> <span class="label ANC">Damage</span> happened because the hurricane <span class="label NOT">hit</span> the Florida coast.
            This case is straightforward, as it is explicitly indicated in the sentence by the word <b>"causing."</b></p>

        <h3>IMPORTANT RULE 1</h3>
        <p><strong>Look for a clear indication in the context (e.g., causation words such as: cause, because, incite, influence, inspire, lead, prompt, push, force, make, set, start, trigger, and so on).
            These indicators can help make the decision when they exist and show that one event caused the other.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>However, not all cases are as clear-cut as (<span style="color: #CD5C5C">hit</span>) and (<span style="color: #28A745">damage</span>). In many cases, there will be no clear indication in the sentence. For example:</strong></p>

        <p class="paragraph">He <span class="label NOT">loaded</span> the gun, <span class="label NOT">shot</span>, and <span class="label ANC">killed</span> the attacker.</p>

        <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Why has, is, or will <span style="color: #28A745">killed</span> happen?</p>
        <div class="checkbox-title">Because of:</div>
        <div class="styled-checkbox-container" style="display: block; height: calc(2 * 30px);">
            <label class="styled-checkbox">
                <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled="disabled">
                <span class="custom-checkbox"></span>
                shot
            </label>
            <label class="styled-checkbox">
                <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled">
                <span class="custom-checkbox"></span>
                loaded
            </label>
        </div>

        <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> Here, we need to use a bit of common sense to determine that <span class="label ANC">killed</span> happened because
            of <span class="label NOT">shot</span>. While the act of <span class="label NOT">loading</span> the gun enabled the attacker to shoot, it was the shooting that directly caused the event.</p>

        <h3>IMPORTANT RULE 2</h3>
        <p><strong>Given an event in context, ask why the event happened, what triggered the event, or what caused it to happen. For example: "Why was the attacker killed?"
            We can search to see if the answer is one of the events in the list.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>However, events are not always triggered by other events. For example:</strong></p>

        <p class="paragraph">She <span class="label NOT">arrived</span> home, <span class="label NOT">connected</span> to the WiFi, and <span class="label ANC">logged</span> into her email account.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">[QUESTION] Why has, is, or will <span style="color: #28A745">logged</span> happen?</p>
        <div class="checkbox-title">Because of:</div>
        <div class="styled-checkbox-container" style="display: block; height: calc(2 * 30px);">
            <label class="styled-checkbox">
                <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled">
                <span class="custom-checkbox"></span>
                arrived
            </label>
            <label class="styled-checkbox">
                <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled">
                <span class="custom-checkbox"></span>
                connected
            </label>
        </div>

        <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The event <span class="label ANC">logged</span> did not happen because she <span class="label NOT">arrived</span> or <span class="label NOT">connected</span>.
            While the <span class="label NOT">connected</span> event enabled her to log into her account, if we ask, "Why did she log into her email account?" a reasonable answer would be that she wanted to check her emails rather than because she connected to the WiFi.
            Events that merely enable the event in question to happen should not be considered as causing events.</p>
